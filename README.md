## Rules:

This game will test your math and memory at the same time.

When you open the game, you will see a random number. Also you will see 4 crystals that hold a random value between 1-12.

Your goal is click on cristals to figure out what value each of the crystals is holding and use the combined value to match the random number that was displayed initially.

If you will be able to match the random number, you will receive a winning point. If you exceed the number, you will get a loosing point.
